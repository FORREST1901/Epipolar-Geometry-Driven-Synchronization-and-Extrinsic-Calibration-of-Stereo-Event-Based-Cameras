# Simultaneous Synchronization and Calibration for Wide-baseline Stereo Event Cameras
## ICRA2024 Paper Submission: Coming Soon

This repository hosts the codebase and dataset for our research paper, "Simultaneous Synchronization and Calibration for Wide-baseline Stereo Event Cameras," currently under review for ICRA2024.

## Abstract

Event-based cameras offer remarkable advantages such as high temporal resolution and low power consumption but suffer from synchronization issues when deployed in multi-camera settings. Our paper introduces a software-based method to achieve millisecond-level synchronization while simultaneously estimating extrinsic parameters. Our approach eliminates the need for specialized hardware, thus making it particularly suitable for wide-baseline configurations. The robustness and applicability of our method are empirically demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments.
